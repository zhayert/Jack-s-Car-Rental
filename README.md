# Jack-s-Car-Rental
I use policy iteration and value iteration respectively to solve Jack's Car Rental.
Please run `main.py` to execute this program.
You can modify code in main.py `mode == test1` to test Policy Iteration or `mode == test2` to test Value Iteration.
Two folders **policy** and **value** store images of the experimental results, generated by `draw_fig()`.
It's worth noting that, in this example, value iteration exhibits a slower pace compared to policy iteration, but I don't know how to explain it.
